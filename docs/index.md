# Welcome

Poets Pie is a production dao headquartered in the metaverse.  Our belief is that poems are the catalyst for film, music, humor, literature and daily life.  Poets Pie collaborates with poets from around the earth.  Poetry like all art is a health tonic that should infuse IRL and the metaverse equally.  We embrace Web3 with a focused precence on the Ethereum and Dotsama ecosystems.    

## NFTs

Poems have always been collectable.  Some in in our group are librarians both at heart and IRL.  While we value physical collections, storing our art on the blockchain is our preferred archive.  Trust is an important aspect of the NFT artists / collector relationship.  We only mint NFTs editions on single chains.  For example, if we mint a video it will either be on Dotsama or Ethereum but not on both.
