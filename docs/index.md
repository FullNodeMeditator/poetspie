# Welcome

Poets Pie is a production dao headquartered in the metaverse.  Our belief is that poems are the catalyst for film, music, humor, literature and daily life.  Poetry like all art is a health tonic that should infuse IRL and the metaverse equally.  We embrace Web3 with a focused precence on the Ethereum and Dotsama ecosystems.    

## NFTs

Poems have always been collectable.  While we value physical collections, storing our art on the blockchain is our preferred archive.  Trust is an important aspect of the NFT artists / collector relationship.  We only mint editions on single chains.  For example, a minted NFT will either be on Dotsama or Ethereum but not on both...yet someday in the near future cross-chain NFTs will be a reality.
