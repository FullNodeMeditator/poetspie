# Welcome

Poets Pie is a production [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization).  Our belief is that poems are the catalyst for the arts and daily life.  Poetry like all art is a health tonic that should infuse real life and the metaverse equally.  We embrace Web3 with a multichain perspective.    


## Collectibles

Poems have always been collectable.  While we value physical collections, storing our art on the blockchain is our preferred archive.  Trust is an important aspect of the NFT artists / collector relationship.  We only mint editions on single chains.  For example, a minted NFT will either be on Dotsama or Ethereum but not on both...yet someday in the near future cross-chain NFTs will be a reality.
