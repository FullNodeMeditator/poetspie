# Babies Smile

***

Skunk says personal pain is broadcast, harp strings shake spice flakes\
babies smile and grab food, Skunk says cherries fall, money in the cave, tap click tap\
sit there, lose hair, drink coffee, fluorescent breath baby aspirin commute\
original, new, spirit, sweat drop, documents present visualization broken\
skunk says connect the data hub, grill the Angus grill the portabello\
film the child, splashing in the muddy puddle, film the child swinging laughing\
watching them scan, tap the numbers clap clap clap saving to the cloud\
breathing the sunny Baltimore, inner harbor, federal hill, across the years\
babies dance, grandfather legs ache and splay\
with each beat urge and constrain learn to play connect public fruit\
on the ground, in the mouth, fermented and fallen sacrifices skunk says babies smile\
grown fabrics chafe the relief of cool air on the buttocks of music tickling swinging as banks close harp strings shake dreams burn slowly dripping dance steps sweat drops\
skunk says I can see a breathe a single human conviction an infinite odor potent journey swinging sitting in the hospital, spraying expanding storing it in the cloud.\
