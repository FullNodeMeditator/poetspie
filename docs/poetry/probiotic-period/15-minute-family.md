# 15-minute family

Before my brother comes home\
and the video games start\
I jot down these five words\
alcove, marvin, mitten, moots\
all of it was up for question\
that is the expression I used most\
open, unrendered strings of text housed on paper\
then transfered like cardboard shipping boxes\
in the night, over air, to the wallet address\
beeping and blasting, as my brother throws his coat\
I jot down\
fifteen minutes\
and the video games\
shoots\
the kitten purrs\
marvin sits in the alcove\
before my mom comes home\
