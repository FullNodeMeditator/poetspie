# Rope Swing
If you find one, arcing deep into water, 
Peel and release. 
I did this once— The memory, the splash! 
Each summer, by the bank, 
Hoping it returns— A moment whole, 
A turtle leaping, exploding off its log. 
Now children gather, 
New lake, new hands grip the rope. 
We grow together, we let go. 
Spending months within burrows, waves of digital heat-quenched, 
In one arc, the weight, airborne lives crossing 
Bare laughs, sunlit in motion,
Each of us climbing limbs to add our ropes,
Water murmuring patiently,
splash
