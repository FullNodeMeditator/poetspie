# loop-hole in the universe

The day will come when a loop-hole in the universe will allow\
abundant energy for mankind to heat and cool\
grow and sustain our lives and travel boundless\
will you be ready, for logarithmic opportunities\
to step into plasma bubbles brilliant and warm\
perform like a robotic savant, change the rhythm of breath, exchange truth, replace nature, the horse remembers when it pulled, you rode, soil remembers, you drew upon the straw, chiseled children, scrambled meals from the fungus under the balsam moist hydrogen, one solar pad beaten vocal blood under each river lowers, each creature dries as the energy flows\
a planet far drives a single car, sleep awake ready, for the exhale energy for mankind
