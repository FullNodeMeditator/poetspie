# Steps in the Estonian bog

***

Late for dinner\
for love\
for trials\
missed the opportunity\
for success\
for without giving in\
negotiating agreement\
Late for church\
for work\
for peace\
missed the transport\
home to coffee to hugs to groups\
of kids\
playing tag, sliding down\
climbing up\
for love\
for trials\
missed the words\
of thoughts beyond at dawn not candy\
sunsets with daughters\
muddy pants, steps in the Estonian bog\
for work\
for peace\
of kids climbing up\
in the hospital\
sleeping, for success\
sliding\
early for death
