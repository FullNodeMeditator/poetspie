# Library Doors

###

***

Library door, home translation,\
squirrels in hallways, snow on eaves\
shelves of adoration, architectural maintenance deferred\
upon fiscal single birth, each parent cries\
follow instinct aisles thoughts on paper\
scheduled, canceled, healthful abundant knowledge placed orderly\
sitting still in accordance with a push, write\
open doors tell a story, incident when the device was black\
a writing utensil, a scrap receipt\
slogans of youth true long idea branches\
aloft toward the sun leaf-filtered like words bunched crazy moments drafted-dancing\
delivering ideas, digging holes\
moments on the quiet shelves\
carried to\
stories alive off stage
