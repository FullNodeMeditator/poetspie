# A little bench for each artist

***

Yesterday I discovered a new artist\
one that died years ago\
but whose songs, writings, and interviews\
exist\
and appeal to my sensibility\
I wonder how many more\
how much more\
what else\
exists\
subconscious perhaps\
all of it\
notice in a moment\
there is a lifeâ€™s worth\
open for business, stored on your shelf and under the grass, beneath the treehouse,\
tangled in the roots keeping whispering hope parallel\
bright and primary but out of reach\
tomorrow I will write about another artist\
one that runs through the tumbled stones of heavy head\
that flows out splays of words\
into this world on screens and stage of thoughts transom to bed\
happy Friday, to enjoy the gap of known\
to sit on a bench\
each artist swinging legs, blinking\
noticing the sip of tea\
discovered works roar afloat the human sea.
