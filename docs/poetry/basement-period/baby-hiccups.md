# Baby Hiccups

###

***

Woodchuck or possum\
the baby has hiccups\
on the front bumper\
one or the other\
is dead\
on my way home from\
helping the elderly\
the poor\
the sick\
I killed a creature with\
gasoline\
plastic\
loan payments\
while it is true\
attention to the underground office microwave\
cleanliness isnâ€™t addressed in my email\
or the spelling\
this morning I did notice\
your medal of achievement\
on the horizon\
mirror ball blaze burnt\
unlike anything in the basement\
much like the soul\
the spirit\
of the woodchuck\
and nature of\
baby hiccups
