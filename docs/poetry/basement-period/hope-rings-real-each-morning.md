# Hope rings real each morning

### Hope rings real each morning

***

Your accordion wants to sing\
Your baby wants to laugh\
The people want to feel\
hope rings real each morning\
as their eyes open\
bellows close and push\
a melody that lifts toes\
jugglers throw apples high\
mothers sing, crowds clap,\
coins fall, true words echo\
feet want to tap real moments\
seen each voice is lean\
laugh baby, release your father\
hope rings real each morning
