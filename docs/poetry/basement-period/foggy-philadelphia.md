# Foggy Philadelphia

***

In the square, a fountain pushes water upward\
joined with clouds ladled with coarse hands of constellations\
fresh and full, aglow from hotel window lights\
bus brakes, soft even breaths from children under blankets\
pure coconut, salted skin, biological rinse huddled\
on the street corner, listening as a doctor explains to his wife\
why he wonâ€™t be home and she must feed the children alone\
trolley moves, strategic, the position aligns to city with points\
abundance under the atmosphere, reliance on words shared, ideas awoken\
pure human ladled flow amidst\
droplets of Philadelphia
