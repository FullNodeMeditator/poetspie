# Cold Storage Poem

###

***

Thieves are upon these words\
plucking, boiling undergarments of thought\
trading fenced verse, attacking\
neuro-pathway programs\
transferred each morning\
each sip of the stream\
developed early in childhood,\
protected, reclaimed with crayons and glued\
magnetized, naturally resistant\
like apple bins, aged ideas are pressed\
cider ferments to be hoarded during\
cyber prohibition, a momentary burst of free thinking\
safely buried by the squirrels amidst\
this autumn data\
cold and secure\
an alive flag hung high through a\
secure tumbler of\
human coded sounds
