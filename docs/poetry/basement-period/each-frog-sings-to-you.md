# Each frog sings to you

***

Beneath the asphalt\
In layers of mud\
At night the ear is\
against the ground\
spring arrives\
the frogs sing\
This is when we are alone\
At the bank\
Withdrawing while the insects\
Take interest, nourish the frogs\
Try to isolate, identify, focus new ideas shared with teachers and neighbors\
Your peep, croak, rhythmic rolls\
squeezed persuing birth, journey in mud\
Beneath before sensational news\
Nourish children at night\
gurgle answers of bite\
Each frog sings to you\
translate fears through the throats,\
beneath the roads\
follow the frogs, or are they toads?\
\
