# Plastic Keys Touching my Fingers

***

When I look up\
into the clouds\
or out across\
the ocean\
there is an unquestionable\
sense of well being\
like slumber\
like kisses\
like the buoyancy of love or laughter or fresh baked bread\
then as I sit later\
in the office with a screen and plastic keys touching my fingers\
questions arrive\
and I close my eyes\
to let the breeze from my heart\
carry them up\
into the clouds
