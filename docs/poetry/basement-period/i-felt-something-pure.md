# I felt something pure

I felt something pure\
in the shadows of\
a giant cow statue\
something innocent\
like the labor of mankind\
to create, to replicate\
what nature first aroused\
to catch the drips from the utters\
to feed\
each other as we build lives\
that two syllables\
from birth to death\
is a soft sustaining moo

&#x20; as my young daughter scurries\
beneath the\
cow statue\
as the smart data\
cellular waves\
pass through the\
farm animals on the journey to\
finger touch\
dusk continues to lure\
each bird, person, rabbit\
mankind continues to create\
statues of nature\
of derivatives\
giant pigs and giant manatees\
investing souls\
yodeling to each other\
calls of a cowherd\
daddy take me to the cow\
daddy daddy take me to the cow
