# Shave the hog’s ear

***

Shave the hog’s ear<br>
to make a more youthful appearance<br>
for the hog yearns to be young<br>
kiss the hog it is pretty, tastes salty on the tongue<br>
Shave the hog’s ear drink a cold beer<br>
study historical facts<br>
learn about operation pig bristle, it’s real<br>
paint your house with pig brushes, fill your belly ham<br>
pig skin like yours, supple boars at the spa go with mama<br>
here the hoofs touch systems cages closed doors,<br>
for the hog yearns to be young<br>
shave the hog’s ear<br>
