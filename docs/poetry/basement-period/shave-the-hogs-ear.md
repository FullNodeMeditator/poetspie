# Shave the hog’s ear

###

***

Shave the hog’s ear\
to make a more youthful appearance\
for the hog yearns to be young\
kiss the hog it is pretty, tastes salty on the tongue\
Shave the hog’s ear drink a cold beer\
study historical facts\
learn about operation pig bristle, it’s real\
paint your house with pig brushes, fill your belly ham\
pig skin like yours, supple boars at the spa go with mama\
here the hoofs touch systems cages closed doors,\
for the hog yearns to be young\
shave the hog’s ear
